# iOS Coding Challenge

## The Challenge
Write a movies app using [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). The app should start by displaying a list of movies currently in theatres. The list should be searchable with autocompletion. Movies can be tapped to view more details.

3. Write an autocompletion search for the movie list. (hint: use the [/search/movie](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies) endpoint).

## Code requirements
* Code should be written in Swift.
* Views should use autolayout
* Views should be written programmatically.
* Third-party libraries should be used sparingly.
